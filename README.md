# Hospital_Mangement_Sysytem
This is a Hospital Management System built using Java Swing for the front-end and JavaDB (Derby Database) for the back-end. The system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage hospital activities such as handling doctors, patients, and diagnoses. It includes a secure login page for authentication.

Features
Login Page: Allows authorized users to log into the system.
Doctor Management: Add, view, update, and delete doctor information.
Patient Management: Add, view, update, and delete patient details.
Diagnosis Page: Record diagnosis for patients with relevant medical information.
Database Integration: All data is stored and retrieved from a JavaDB (Apache Derby) database.
Tech Stack
Java Swing: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
JavaDB (Derby): For database management.
JDBC: For connecting and performing CRUD operations on the JavaDB.
